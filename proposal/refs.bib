abstract = {Abstract Throughout the past decades, the graphics community has spent major resources on the research and development of physics simulators on the mission to computer-generate behaviors achieving outstanding visual effects or to make the virtual world indistinguishable from reality. The variety and impact of recent research based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) demonstrates the concept's importance as one of the most versatile tools for the simulation of fluids and solids. With this survey, we offer an overview of the developments and still-active research on physics simulation methodologies based on SPH that has not been addressed in previous SPH surveys. Following an introduction about typical SPH discretization techniques, we provide an overview over the most used incompressibility solvers and present novel insights regarding their relation and conditional equivalence. The survey further covers recent advances in implicit and particle-based boundary handling and sampling techniques. While SPH is best known in the context of fluid simulation we discuss modern concepts to augment the range of simulatable physical characteristics including turbulence, highly viscous matter, deformable solids, as well as rigid body contact handling. Besides the purely numerical approaches, simulation techniques aided by machine learning are on the rise. Thus, the survey discusses recent data-driven approaches and the impact of differentiable solvers on artist control. Finally, we provide context for discussion by outlining existing problems and opportunities to open up new research directions.},

  abstract={We propose a novel formulation of the projection method for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We combine a symmetric SPH pressure force and an SPH discretization of the continuity equation to obtain a discretized form of the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). In contrast to previous projection schemes, our system does consider the actual computation of the pressure force. This incorporation improves the convergence rate of the solver. Furthermore, we propose to compute the density deviation based on velocities instead of positions as this formulation improves the robustness of the time-integration scheme. We show that our novel formulation outperforms previous projection schemes and state-of-the-art SPH methods. Large time steps and small density deviations of down to 0.01 percent can be handled in typical scenarios. The practical relevance of the approach is illustrated by scenarios with up to 40 million SPH particles.},

    abstract = {Most variational principles in classical mechanics are based on the principle of least action, which is only a stationary principle. In contrast, Gauss' principle of least constraint is a true minimum principle. In this paper, we apply Gauss' principle to the mechanics of incompressible flows, thereby discovering the fundamental quantity that Nature minimizes in most flows encountered in everyday life. We show that the magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain is minimum at every instant of time. We call it the principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG). It turns a fluid mechanics problem into a minimization one. We demonstrate this intriguing property by solving four classical problems in fluid mechanics using the PMPG without resorting to Navier–Stokes' equation. In some cases, the PMPG minimization approach is not any more efficient than solving Navier–Stokes'. However, in other cases, it is more insightful and efficient. In fact, the inviscid version of the PMPG allowed solving the long-standing problem of the aerohydrodynamic lift over smooth cylindrical shapes where Euler's equation fails to provide a unique answer. The PMPG transcends Navier–Stokes' equations in its applicability to non-Newtonian fluids with arbitrary constitutive relations and fluids subject to arbitrary forcing (e.g., electromagnetic).},

abstract = {Fluid droplets behave significantly different from larger fluid bodies. At smaller scales, surface tension and friction between fluids and the boundary play an essential role and are even able to counteract gravitational forces. There are quite a few existing approaches that model surface tension forces within an SPH environment. However, as often as not, physical correctness and simulation stability are still major concerns with many surface tension formulations. We propose a new approach to compute surface tension that is both robust and produces the right amount of surface tension.Conversely, less attention was given to friction forces at the fluid-boundary interface. Recent experimental research indicates that Coulomb friction can be used to describe the behavior of droplets resting on a slope. Motivated by this, we develop a novel friction force formulation at the fluid-boundary interface following the Coulomb model, which allows us to replicate a new range of well known fluid behavior such as the motion of rain droplets on a window pane.Both forces are combined with an IISPH variant into one unified solver that is able to simultaneously compute strongly coupled surface tension, friction and pressure forces.},

abstract = {Interactive rigid body simulation is important for robot simulation and virtual design. A&nbsp;vital part of the simulation is the computation of contact forces. This paper addresses the contact force problem, as used in interactive simulation. The contact force problem can be formulated in the form of a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP), which can be solved using an iterative splitting method, such as the projected Gauss–Seidel (PGS) method. We present a novel method for solving the NCP problem by applying a Fletcher–Reeves type nonlinear nonsmooth conjugate gradient (NNCG) type method. We analyze and present experimental convergence behavior and properties of the new method. Our results show that the NNCG method has at least the same convergence rate as PGS, and in many cases better.},

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.}
